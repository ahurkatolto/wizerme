# Wizer.me
 - A javascript code snippet to print Wizer.me test answers to the browser console (and sometimes to the page itself).
### üîÆ How to use?
1. Open a Wizer.me test in your browser, then open the browser's console (F12 usually, it opens a side window, look for "Console").
2. Copy-paste this javascript code into that console.
3. Press enter to run the script.
4. Your tasks with their answers are here, most probably. (it's still an uncomplete script so...)
### üî£ Code to copy:
 - Everything from wizerme.js above, or here's a link to it: [wizerme.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurkatolto/wizerme/main/wizerme.js)
### ‚ùó Important:
 - The script can become outdated if Wizer.me updates their code. Please leave an issue if that happens, I'll try to fix it quickly. (Last tested: 2021.02.09.)
 - Supported task types: Multiple Choice, Matching, Sorting, Blanks, Fill On An Image (with on-page ~accurate positions), Table
 - In development: Word Search Puzzle
